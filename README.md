# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors vs AI

A computer vision-powered twist on the classic game **Rock, Paper, Scissors**, where your **hand gestures** control the game — and your opponent is a quick-thinking AI!

Built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**, this project lets you play RPS using just your webcam, detecting your gestures in real-time and pitting them against an AI opponent. No clicks. No buttons. Just hand signs.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Webcam feed** is launched.
2. **Hand gestures** are detected using **MediaPipe Hands**.
3. When the game starts:

   * A **3-second countdown** begins.
   * Your hand gesture is captured.
   * The AI randomly picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
   * A winner is decided based on traditional rules.
4. **Results are displayed**, and the next round begins every 10 seconds.

## 🧠 Features

* 🤖 AI randomly selects its move.
* ✋ Real-time hand gesture recognition (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
* ⏱ Countdown timer for gesture capture.
* 🪞 Mirror-style webcam feed.
* 🖥 Visual game feedback (Player move, AI move, result).
* 🎯 Works entirely from your webcam—no keyboard or mouse needed after starting!
